"""IRT prune / discrimination screen for the calibration set (research-grounding §12, Q1).

The first characterization run **saturated** — three of six local models scored 1.00 on
the 20-item set, so the top of the panel had no discrimination (§12). The fix is two-part:
author plausible-vs-subtly-wrong PAIRS (``admission_pairs.json``) AND screen the bank for
items that actually separate strong from weak judges. This module is that screen.

Why model-free is PRIMARY here
------------------------------
Classical 2PL IRT MLE needs ~200–500 respondents (Schroeders & Gnambs 2025); ai_crucible's
panel is ~6 models, far below that floor. So the **model-free point-biserial / variance
screen is the primary instrument** (ATLAS, Peiyu Li et al. 2025, arXiv:2511.04689: drop
items with >95% accuracy / <1% variance / point-biserial r_pb < 0.1), and a Bayesian-prior
IRT fit (py-irt; Lalor, Wu & Yu 2019, EMNLP) is an *optional* secondary path
(:func:`fit_irt_bayesian`) used only when py-irt is installed. py-irt stays a LAZY optional
import — importing this module never requires it (build-law 4).

What "discrimination" means operationally
-----------------------------------------
* **Variance** — across the panel, how split is the verdict on this item? An item every
  model gets right (or every model gets wrong) has ~zero variance: it cannot separate
  models, so it is **saturated** and pruned. This is the §12 failure made measurable.
* **Point-biserial** — does getting *this* item right correlate with being a *stronger*
  model overall (higher total score)? A high r_pb means the item tracks ability; r_pb≈0
  means right/wrong on it is unrelated to skill (a coin-flip item) and it is pruned. The
  item is excluded from the total it is scored against (corrected item-total correlation,
  the standard discrimination index), so an item never inflates its own r_pb.

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md)
------------------------------------------------------
* **PIN_PER_STEP — 2:** the screen is a pure, deterministic function of the response
  matrix — identical input → identical kept/dropped split, so a prune decision is
  replayable from the recorded matrix without any model call.
* **ANDON_AUTHORITY — n/a:** a leaf analysis; the harness halts on its output, the screen
  raises a structured ``ValueError`` on malformed input rather than returning a silent
  wrong split.
* **NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a:** pure read/compute; no irreversible action to undo.
* **DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 2:** consumes only the already-graded boolean matrix
  (``correct``), never gold labels nor model internals — grading lives upstream with the
  scorer (§11.6).
* **UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — n/a:** no human checkpoint at this layer; the thresholds
  are the director's calibrated knobs (§12 perturbation audit lives in the profiler).
* **EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 2:** this *is* the item-quality verifier — it screens the
  instrument itself for the saturation the §12 verification pass caught on the first run.
