"""The seat-or-screen admission test — turn metrics into a :class:`SeatDecision`.

:func:`build_profile` runs the §11.1 metrics (:mod:`ai_crucible.characterize.metrics`) over
a model's :class:`~ai_crucible.characterize.types.JudgmentRecord`s and applies the **seat
gates** to produce a :class:`~ai_crucible.characterize.types.JudgeProfile` with a
SEAT / SCREEN / REJECT decision, human-legible ``notes`` explaining *why*, and a derived
``reliability_weight`` for the panel aggregator (:mod:`ai_crucible.characterize.aggregate`).

**§12 calibration redesign (2026-06-01 — the authoritative gate; supersedes §11.1).**
The first real characterization run (6 local models × 20 items × k=3) self-diagnosed two
defects, both corrected here:

1. **The κ gate was INVERTED (THE fix).** The old gate screened a judge whose κ sat
   *above* the human baseline (``|z| ≥ 1``). Han et al. 2025 ("Judge's Verdict",
   arXiv:2510.09738) keeps such **super-consistent** judges as **Tier-1B: valid,
   top-ranked, seated** — its own four highest-κ models are z>1. ai_crucible's two-sided
   screen was a misreading of its own source. The gate is now a **ONE-SIDED FLOOR**: a
   judge passes the agreement gate when ``κ ≥ human_baseline − margin`` (the margin floors
   at the lower CI of the human baseline). A ``z > 1`` ("super-consistent") judge
   **passes and is seated**; its only consequence is a ``review_flag`` (stored in
   ``notes`` + ``metadata["review_flag"]``) — a flag for *later* human review IF a near-
   perfect κ co-occurs with high human disagreement on the same items (Richie, Grover &
   Tsui 2022, ACL 2022.bionlp-1.26: a well-specified model can legitimately exceed IAA),
   **never a downgrade**. Net: a κ=1.0 judge now SEATS (with a review flag), not screens.

2. **The brittle 7-threshold binary AND is replaced** by a **difficulty-normalized
   continuous quality score** (:func:`~ai_crucible.characterize.metrics.quality_score` over
   :func:`~ai_crucible.characterize.metrics.difficulty_weighted_accuracy`) and a **selective,
   CI-based** decision (Traub 2024, "selective classification", arXiv:2407.01032 — score
   across the operating curve, not at one cut; Sarmah 2024, arXiv:2412.12148 — derive the
   cutoff from data, not by fiat): **seat** if the score's CI lower bound clears the
   quality floor, **screen** if the CI straddles the floor (uncertainty, not failure),
   **reject** if the CI is entirely below. A ship-time :func:`perturbation_audit` jitters
   every threshold ±1 SE and reports the decision-flip rate (the §8.3 Alzahrani
   "When Benchmarks are Targets" lens applied to the admission gate; Eiras 2025,
   arXiv:2503.04474 — style shifts a judge's FNR up to 0.24, so threshold stability must
   be measured).

The gate ladder (§12-corrected, in decreasing severity):

* **REJECT** — the judge is not usable for this role at all. Hard gates (any one fails):
    - objective (difficulty-weighted) accuracy has **no real margin over chance** — the
      Wilson 95% lower bound is ≤ 0.5 (the §1 small-N-admissible test reused from
      ``ai_crucible.scoring.stats``), **or**
    - hard agreement failure: Pearson ``r < 0.80`` (the §11.1 #2 first gate — a judge
      whose ratings don't even correlate with gold cannot be reliability-weighted), **or**
    - the **one-sided κ floor**: ``κ < human_baseline − margin`` (agreement structure
      below the human level), **or**
    - all hard gates pass but the **quality-score CI is entirely below the floor**.
* **SCREEN** — usable only as a *cheap pre-filter whose verdicts are always escalated,
  never final* (Jung, Brahman & Choi 2024, "Trust or Escalate", arXiv:2407.18370). A
  model lands here when the hard gates pass but the **quality-score CI straddles the
  floor** (genuine uncertainty), or alt-test ``ω < 0.5`` (substitution not acceptable —
  Calderon et al. 2025, arXiv:2501.10970).
* **SEAT** — full panel member (reliability-weighted): hard gates pass **and** the
  quality-score CI lower bound clears the floor **and** ``ω ≥ 0.5`` (when measured). A
  ``review_flag`` does **not** change the decision — a super-consistent judge seats.

``reliability_weight`` (consumed by CARE-style aggregation, §11.4) is derived only for
SEAT/SCREEN models (REJECT → ``0.0``). It is the continuous quality score itself,
floored slightly above 0 for a seated/screened judge and halved for SCREEN (their
verdicts escalate, so they barely move the aggregate). This unifies "how good is the
judge" (the score) with "how much does it count" (the weight) — §12's continuous frame.

**Standards compliance (the six)** — the binding section for this domain:

- **PIN_PER_STEP — 3.** Every metric is a pure deterministic reduction over the records;
  given a pinned ``(model, quant, prompt, fixture-hash)`` the resulting profile is
  byte-for-byte reproducible. Thresholds are frozen ``SeatGates`` constants stamped into
  ``metadata["thresholds"]`` (provenance), and the gate *decision* is factored into a
  pure :func:`_decide_from_metrics` so :func:`perturbation_audit` replays it exactly with
  jittered thresholds.
- **ANDON_AUTHORITY — 2.** A single failed hard gate halts promotion (REJECT stops the
  model joining the panel); :func:`perturbation_audit` is itself an andon instrument — a
  high decision-flip rate signals the gate is measuring threshold noise, not the judge,
  and should block the admission decision until the set/thresholds are firmed.
- **NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a (skip).** ``build_profile``/``perturbation_audit`` perform
  **no irreversible tool call** — they are pure functions returning a dataclass / dict
  (no publish/push/release/DB write). Per the workflow-standards skip rule, a
  compensators table is not required for a pure in-memory computation; the calling
  harness owns any persistence + its undo.
- **DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3.** Gold labels live *in the records the grader supplies*,
  not in the profiled model; the profile module never sees a model runtime. Metrics,
  gate logic, and aggregation are three files split by what changes together (§10.6).
- **UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — 3.** The §12 selective decision *is* the uncertainty gate:
  a straddling CI → SCREEN (escalate, Jung 2024) rather than a forced pass/fail; the
  ``review_flag`` routes the genuinely ambiguous super-consistent case to a human without
  penalizing it; ``notes`` frame each outcome contrastively.
- **EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 3.** The whole point of the panel these profiles compose is that
  no model verifies its own family's output; ``family_pref_delta`` *measures* the bias
  this guards against, and ``aggregate.passes_submodularity`` refuses two judges whose
  *errors* correlate. The §12 reversal was itself caught by the citation-verification
  pass — EXTERNAL_VERIFIER applied to the research.

            bias), family/length tags (bias panel), and ``metadata["difficulty"]`` (the

            absent are recorded as "not measured" and do **not** fail the model.
        human_human_kappa: the human–human baseline κ for the one-sided floor + the review
            z-score (§12). Defaults to 0.80; §12 recommends estimating μ_human/σ_human
            from real data rather than hardcoding it.
        records_per_annotator: optional ``{annotator_id: [...]}`` including a ``"judge"``
            entry, used to compute the alt-test ω (§11.1 #3). When ``None``, ω is not

    """Jitter each admission threshold ±1 SE and report the decision-flip rate — §12 / §8.3.

    Alzahrani et al. 2024 ("When Benchmarks are Targets", arXiv:2402.01781) show single
    weight perturbations flip benchmark rankings 63% of the time; §12 applies that lens to
    the *admission gate*. A robust seat/screen/reject decision should not change when a
    threshold wobbles within its own measurement noise. This audit:

    1. measures the judge once (the metrics are a function of the records, not the
       thresholds — so they are not recomputed under jitter — PIN_PER_STEP);
    2. for each scalar threshold, derives a small ``± jitter·SE`` step and re-runs the
       **pure** :func:`_decide_from_metrics` at the bumped value, holding everything else
       fixed (one-at-a-time, the Alzahrani single-perturbation design);
    3. reports the fraction of perturbed runs whose decision differs from the baseline.

    The per-threshold SE is the natural scale for each knob: thresholds that sit on the
    accuracy/score scale use the Wilson half-width of the accuracy CI over ``n_items``
    (the same small-N interval the gate itself uses); the κ floor margin uses the human
    baseline's κ SE; the rest use a small fixed delta. ``jitter`` scales the step (1.0 =
    ±1 SE).

    Args:
        records: the judge's calibration records (non-empty).
        human_human_kappa: the human baseline κ (as in :func:`build_profile`).
        records_per_annotator: optional alt-test annotator records (as in
            :func:`build_profile`).
        gates: the baseline thresholds to perturb (defaults to :class:`SeatGates`).
        jitter: SE multiplier for the perturbation step (default 1.0 = ±1 SE).

    Returns:
        A dict with:

        * ``"baseline_decision"`` — the unperturbed :class:`SeatDecision` value (str);
        * ``"flip_rate"`` — fraction of perturbed runs that changed the decision, in
          ``[0, 1]``;
        * ``"n_perturbations"`` — how many perturbed runs were evaluated;
        * ``"flips"`` — a list of ``{threshold, direction, decision}`` for the runs that
          flipped (legible "which knob is fragile" report — the andon signal).

        ValueError: if ``records`` is empty.
