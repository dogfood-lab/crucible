"""The judge-admission metrics (research-grounding §11.1, recalibrated by §12).

Each function is a **pure, deterministic** reduction over a ``list[JudgmentRecord]``
— same records grade identically tomorrow (the §1 "live external dependencies are
forbidden" discipline that ``ai_crucible.scoring.stats`` already follows). These are the
measurement primitives the §11.1 *seat-or-screen* admission test is built on; the
gate logic that turns these numbers into a :class:`~ai_crucible.characterize.types.SeatDecision`
lives in :mod:`ai_crucible.characterize.profile`, and the panel-level aggregation in
:mod:`ai_crucible.characterize.aggregate`.

**§12 calibration redesign (2026-06-01, after the first characterization run).** The
first run self-diagnosed two defects this module + the gate layer now fix:

* The κ two-gate was **INVERTED** — it screened super-consistent judges (κ above the
  human baseline, z>1) when Han et al. 2025 ("Judge's Verdict", arXiv:2510.09738)
  keeps them as **Tier-1B: valid, top-ranked, seated**. The gate becomes a *one-sided
  floor* (see :mod:`ai_crucible.characterize.profile`); :func:`kappa_zscore` still reports
  the signed z (the profile layer reads ``z>1`` only as a *review flag*, never a
  downgrade).
* The brittle 7-threshold binary AND is replaced by a **difficulty-normalized
  continuous quality score** (:func:`difficulty_weighted_accuracy` + :func:`quality_score`)
  with a **selective, CI-based** seat/screen/reject decision and a **perturbation audit**
  (jitter thresholds ±1 SE, report the decision-flip rate — the §8.3 Alzahrani lens on
  the admission gate). These three live in :mod:`ai_crucible.characterize.profile`; the
  difficulty-weighting + score combiner that feed them are the pure reductions here.

The six (each tied to the paper that grounds it):

1. **Objective accuracy** — fraction ``predicted == gold`` on ground-truth-labeled
   items. Many strong judges sit barely above 0.5, so the gate (in ``profile``)
   requires a *real margin*, not just >0.5 (Tan et al. 2024, "JudgeBench",
   arXiv:2410.12784).
2. **Agreement (two-gate)** — Pearson ``r`` vs gold/human **and** Cohen's κ, plus a
   κ *z-score* against the human–human baseline (|z|<1 = "human-like"; size is not
   decisive — a 4B can correlate yet fail consistency) (Han et al. 2025, "Judge's
   Verdict", arXiv:2510.09738).
3. **Substitution (alt-test)** — leave-one-annotator-out winning rate ω; seat only
   if ω ≥ 0.5, else screen-only (Calderon, Reichart & Dror 2025, "alt-test",
   arXiv:2501.10970).
4. **Consistency / test-retest** — 1 − verdict-flip-rate across repeated ``run_index``
   passes; LLM judges have low intra-rater reliability (Haldar & Hockenmaier 2025,
   "Rating Roulette", arXiv:2510.27106).
5. **Calibration (ECE)** — expected calibration error from confidence vs correctness;
   down-weight overconfident judges (quantization worsens calibration — Proskurina et
   al. 2024, arXiv:2405.00632). Per §12, :func:`expected_calibration_error` returns
   ``None`` (not an error) when no record carries a confidence — "not measured" is a
   first-class outcome the continuous score handles, since the calibration set may have
   no logprob/vote-fraction confidence wired yet.
6. **Bias panel** — position-swap flip-rate, verbosity bias, and a same-vs-different-
   family agreement delta (self/family preference, §1/§3).

Two §12-added reductions feed the continuous gate:

* **Difficulty-weighted accuracy** (:func:`difficulty_weighted_accuracy`) — weights each
  item by ``metadata["difficulty"]`` when present (else unweighted), the model-free
  stand-in for IRT θ-normalization on a ~6-respondent panel where classical 2PL MLE is
  infeasible (ATLAS, Peiyu Li et al. 2025, arXiv:2511.04689; sample-size, Schroeders &
  Gnambs 2025). Raw accuracy is distorted on easy-only sets — ai_crucible's exact failure.
* **Continuous quality score** (:func:`quality_score`) — a calibrated 0–1 combiner of
  difficulty-weighted accuracy + agreement + consistency, minus ECE and bias penalties
  (§12 Q4). Monotone in every "good" component, so the profile layer can push an
  accuracy confidence interval through it to get a score CI for the selective decision
  (Traub 2024, arXiv:2407.01032 — score across the operating curve, not at one cut).

Implementation reuses scipy (Pearson) and statsmodels (Cohen's κ via
``inter_rater.cohens_kappa``); it deliberately does **not** edit ``ai_crucible.scoring``
— it imports nothing mutable from it. Where a metric is structurally a proportion we
let the *profile* layer reach for Wilson bounds from ``ai_crucible.scoring.stats`` rather
than duplicating them here (keeps each metric a single number; the gate layer adds the
uncertainty).

Standards compliance (the six): see :mod:`ai_crucible.characterize.profile` for the full
section — these primitives carry **PIN_PER_STEP** (pure + deterministic → a profile run
is byte-for-byte replayable) and feed **EXTERNAL_VERIFIER** (the panel that consumes
them is cross-family).

    Raw accuracy is distorted on easy-only sets: the first characterization run had
    three models score 1.00 on a set that *saturated*, giving the gate no discrimination
    at the top. §12's fix is to score difficulty-normalized accuracy — IRT θ adjusts for
    item difficulty (ATLAS, Peiyu Li et al. 2025, arXiv:2511.04689), but with ~6
    respondents classical 2PL MLE is infeasible (needs ~200–500 — Schroeders & Gnambs
    2025, doi:10.1177/25152459251314798), so we use the **model-free** stand-in: weight
    each item by its declared difficulty.

    Each record's difficulty is read from ``metadata["difficulty"]`` (a number, higher =
    harder). Getting a *hard* item right is worth more than getting an easy one right, so
    the weighted accuracy is ``Σ w_i·correct_i / Σ w_i`` over items. When **no** record
    carries a difficulty the function degrades gracefully to plain
    :func:`objective_accuracy` (unweighted) — "not annotated" is the common path for the
    trivial-anchor items and must not penalize the judge. A non-positive or non-numeric
    difficulty is treated as "unweighted for that item" (weight 1.0) rather than raising,
    so a partially-annotated set still scores.

    Where an item is judged multiple times (test-retest ``run_index`` passes) each record
    contributes (the repeats just reinforce the per-item weight) — the result stays in

    Position bias (Shi et al. 2024, arXiv:2406.07791 — research-grounding §3) is the
    pairwise judge's tendency to favor an option because of *where* it sits (A-first vs
    B-first), independent of content. We pair records of the *same item* presented in
    different ``position`` orderings and measure how often the verdict flips with the
    swap. 0.0 = position-invariant (good); 1.0 = the verdict is decided entirely by
    position (a useless judge).

    Records are grouped by ``item_id``; an item *contributes* only if it has records
    under ≥2 distinct ``position`` values. The item is counted as *flipped* iff its
    ``predicted`` verdict is not identical across those positions. The rate is over
    contributing items.

    Verbosity bias (Zheng et al. 2023, arXiv:2306.05685 — §3): judges over-reward

    between answer *length* and the judge's score, **partialled against correctness**
    so legitimate "longer because more complete (and correct)" answers don't read as
    bias. We approximate the partialling cheaply: correlate length with the judge's
    *error* (predicted − gold) rather than raw score — a judge with no verbosity bias
    has length uncorrelated with its error; a verbose-biased judge's error grows with
    length (it inflates long answers). The returned value is ``|r|`` so it is a
    magnitude the gate can threshold (0.0 = unbiased; → 1.0 = strongly length-driven).

    §12 retires the multi-threshold binary gate in favor of a single
    **difficulty-normalized, calibrated, continuous** judge-quality score, scored across
    the operating curve rather than at one cut (Traub 2024, "selective classification",
    arXiv:2407.01032 — a single fixed threshold can violate monotonicity). This is the
    pure combiner; the profile layer feeds it ``accuracy`` =
    :func:`difficulty_weighted_accuracy` (the §12 difficulty normalization) and the other
    measured components, and pushes an *accuracy confidence interval* through it (holding
    the deterministic factors fixed) to get a score CI for the selective decision.

    Form — a convex blend of the three "good" components, then multiplicative penalties:

        base    = w_acc·acc + w_agr·max(0, r) + w_cons·consistency        ∈ [0, 1]

    The blend weights sum to 1 so ``base`` stays in ``[0, 1]``; the penalties are in
    ``(0, 1]``, so the product is bounded in ``[0, 1]`` and is **monotone**: strictly
    non-decreasing in accuracy / agreement / consistency and non-increasing in ECE and
    bias. Monotonicity is the property the selective-CI decision relies on (a higher
    accuracy bound ⇒ a higher score bound). ECE is a *soft* signal (it only bites past
    the soft ceiling and never zeroes the score), matching §11.1; ``None`` ECE
    ("not measured", §12) applies no calibration penalty.

        consistency: test-retest stability in ``[0, 1]`` (1 − flip-rate).
        ece: expected calibration error in ``[0, 1]`` or ``None`` (not measured).
        max_bias: the largest bias magnitude (position / verbosity / |family-pref|) in
            ``[0, 1]``.
