"""Seated-panel artifact store — persist/load the composed panel as a pinned config.

:func:`~ai_crucible.characterize.aggregate.compose_panel` produces the seated panel from a
characterization run; this module makes it **durable**: a small, reviewable JSON artifact
the scorer loads instead of re-deriving the panel every time. The artifact is the
instrument's PIN_PER_STEP receipt — *which* judges sit, with *what* reliability weights,
under *which* ρ-threshold and quorum, and *why* (the composition notes + the dropped
redundancies). It is **generated, not hand-edited** (regenerate it from a run); commit it
so the panel ai_crucible scores with is version-controlled and auditable.

Errors carry the Ship-Gate-B structured shape (``[CODE] message (hint: ...)``) — mirrors
:class:`ai_crucible.calibration.loader.CalibrationLoadError` — so a bad artifact surfaces an
actionable error, never a raw stack.

Standards (the six): **PIN_PER_STEP — 3** — the artifact pins the exact seated set +
weights + ``threshold``/``min_judges`` so a scoring run replays the same panel without
re-running characterization; **NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a** — :func:`save_panel` overwrites
one file (the compensator is git: the artifact is committed, so a bad write is reverted by
version control); EXTERNAL_VERIFIER/ANDON live with :func:`compose_panel` that produced it.
