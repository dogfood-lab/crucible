"""Trace writer (``trace_writer`` module, research-grounding §10.2, swarm-17 finding 5).

Every model/tool/score call the kernel makes is appended here as a structured
:class:`ai_crucible.types.TraceEvent`. Per Vivaria (swarm-17 finding 8) the budget
and trace accounting is **kernel-side, never Solver-self-reported** — the Solver
cannot write its own trace, so transcripts are audit-ready by construction.

:meth:`TraceWriter.to_eval_log` renders the per-attempt record in the **Inspect
AI EvalLog shape** (finding 5): top-level ``eval`` / ``plan`` / ``results`` /
``stats`` / ``samples[]``, each sample carrying
``id, input, target, output, scores, events, metadata, error``.

Large blobs are *not* inlined into events. They are de-duplicated into an
``attachments`` map keyed by their SHA-256 digest (Inspect EvalLog stores large
event content as attachments referenced by digest, finding 5); an event holds
only the short ``ref`` string. Two identical blobs collapse to one attachment.

This module is intentionally Inspect-shape-*compatible* rather than
Inspect-typed: it emits a plain ``dict`` matching the documented EvalLog v2
envelope, so it neither pins nor breaks against Inspect's evolving pydantic API
surface (swarm-17 verification note). The kernel can hand the dict straight to
an Inspect log writer or persist it via :mod:`ai_crucible.attestation`.
