"""Claude model adapter — the Designer/Solver bridge and a cross-family panel anchor.

Claude is the role ai_crucible is built around: the :class:`~ai_crucible.types.RoleName.DESIGNER`
stays Claude by design, and Claude is the default :class:`~ai_crucible.types.RoleName.SOLVER`
(types §10.3). This adapter backs the kernel's injected ``generate`` choke point with
the Anthropic Messages API, and — because the cross-family panel needs a Claude-family
member to *exclude* when Claude is the generator (EXTERNAL_VERIFIER, §10.2) — also
exposes the judge surface so a :class:`~ai_crucible.scoring.judge_panel.JudgePanel` can
drop it structurally when ``generator_family == "claude"``.

It mirrors :class:`~ai_crucible.models.ollama_adapter.OllamaModel`'s public surface
(``complete`` / ``generate`` / ``judge`` / ``as_judge`` / ``judge_item``) so the two
are drop-in interchangeable in the kernel and on the panel. ``family`` is fixed to
``"claude"``.

Injectable client (testability) + secrets
------------------------------------------
The Anthropic client is a **constructor parameter** (``client=None``). When ``None``
the adapter builds a real :class:`anthropic.AsyncAnthropic` lazily at call time —
reading ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` from the environment *then*, never capturing it at
import — so importing this module never requires the ``anthropic`` SDK to be present
and no key is baked in. Tests inject a fake client exposing
``messages.create(*, model, system, messages, max_tokens, temperature, ...)`` and the
suite makes no network call (build-law 3).

Determinism
-----------
Like the Ollama adapter, every request pins ``temperature=0`` for replayability
(PIN_PER_STEP). The Anthropic API has no user-set seed knob, so determinism rests on
``temperature=0`` plus the pinned model id; that pin is recorded in every
:class:`~ai_crucible.characterize.types.JudgmentRecord`'s metadata so a profile run is
reproducible to the extent the API allows.

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md)
------------------------------------------------------
* **PIN_PER_STEP — 3:** model id + ``temperature=0`` + ``max_tokens`` pinned per
  request and echoed into :attr:`JudgmentRecord.metadata`. Proven in
  ``tests/test_models.py``.
* **ANDON_AUTHORITY — n/a / EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 3 / DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 2 /
  UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — n/a:** identical rationale to the Ollama adapter (a leaf
  model client; the panel reads ``.family`` for same-family exclusion; gold labels
  live with the grader, not the adapter). The one addition: this adapter reads a
  **secret** (``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``) — it does so at call time from the env and never
  logs or stores it.
