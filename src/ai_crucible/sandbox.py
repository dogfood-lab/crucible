"""Solver sandbox interface + a local-subprocess provider + the grading topology.

This module owns ai_crucible's *agent↔environment channel* and the *out-of-band
grading topology* (research-grounding.md §10.4; phase-0/swarm-18). It deliberately
ships only the narrow async API + a confined local provider + the workdir-snapshot
hook. The hardened Docker / Cloud-Hypervisor microVM provider is a later wave; the
Phase-1 deliverable is the interface, a local provider, the topology, and an honest
disclosure of what this layer does and does not defend against.

The channel
-----------
The Solver reaches its environment ONLY through :class:`SandboxEnvironment` —
``exec`` / ``read_file`` / ``write_file`` — never a raw shell socket (§10.4,
mirroring UK AISI Inspect's ``SandboxEnvironment``). Every command routes through
``exec`` with a per-call timeout and stdout/stderr size caps. This narrowness is
the whole point: a small, observable surface is auditable; a shell socket is not.

The grading topology (where the real lock lives)
------------------------------------------------
:class:`LocalSandbox` is constructed WITHOUT any reference to the oracle / answer
key — the Solver's environment never contains it (§10.4, SWE-bench ``test_patch``
timing). Grading happens out-of-band: after the Solver halts, :func:`copy_workdir_out`
snapshots the post-run workdir to a grading location, and a SEPARATE process / host
— one the sandbox has no network or filesystem path to — applies the oracle to that
*copy*. The oracle is NEVER inside the sandbox.

Honest residual risk (verbatim-in-spirit from swarm-18 / §10.4)
---------------------------------------------------------------
A plain container is **not** a hard security boundary. A runc / kernel escape of
the Leaky-Vessels class — CVE-2024-21626 (runc working-directory fd leak) or
CVE-2025-31133 (runc ``/dev/null`` masked-path symlink TOCTOU) — lets a determined
Solver reach the host and potentially the oracle. A *local subprocess* provider, as
shipped here, is weaker still: it is process isolation plus a working-directory
confinement, not a security sandbox. The real lock is **out-of-band, post-hoc
grading on a host the sandbox cannot route to** — the oracle being absent from the
Solver's namespace is what protects it, not any in-environment hiding. In-environment
confinement (this module's path checks; a future container's ``cap_drop: ALL`` +
seccomp + ``read_only`` + ``network_mode: none``; a microVM for untrusted generated
code) is **defense-in-depth, not the boundary.** Treat it that way.

Standards compliance (the six; research-grounding §10.7)
--------------------------------------------------------
- **PIN_PER_STEP — 1:** the local provider takes no image digest; reproducibility
  pinning is the future Docker provider's job. (Remediation: digest-pinned image in
  the container-provider wave.)
- **ANDON_AUTHORITY — 2:** per-call ``timeout`` + output caps halt a runaway command
  at the call boundary (``timed_out=True`` / truncated streams) before bad output
  propagates downstream.
- **NAMED_COMPENSATORS — 2:** :meth:`LocalSandbox.cleanup` (and the context-manager
  exit) is the named teardown for the only irreversible local action — creating the
  temp workdir. Owner: kernel-core wave. No external/irreversible calls are made here
  (no publish/release/network), so no compensators table is required.
- **DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3:** the secret (oracle / answer key) is decomposed OUT of
  the sandbox by construction — :class:`LocalSandbox` cannot be handed it, and
  :func:`copy_workdir_out` hands grading only a copy of the workdir. The split *is*
  this principle.
- **UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — n/a:** this module has no human checkpoint.
- **EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 2:** the topology guarantees the verifier runs in a separate
  process/host the sandbox cannot reach; the provider here is the generator side only
  and holds no grading authority.
