"""Tier-3 chrome + the sealed-boundary guard.

This module owns the *un-scored* side of the **Sealed Boundary** (research-
grounding §10.1(d,e)): the engagement/competitive chrome (rank, leaderboard,
catalog standings, prizes) that motivates the human watching the run, and the
runtime guard that proves this chrome never leaks into the context window the
model solves in.

The animating principle (swarm-25): *a stake the model can perceive influencing
is a stake it will optimize toward, so every motivating signal must live strictly
on the un-scored side of a one-way boundary.* Framing alone moves choices
4.3%→68.8% (Wang & Zhang 2026, arXiv:2603.19282); a single prompt change moves
cheating 92%→1% (Zhong et al. 2025, ImpossibleBench, arXiv:2510.20270); eval-
awareness scales with capability and can't be scrubbed once cued (Chaudhary 2025,
arXiv:2509.13333). The only robust lever is *not emitting eval/competition cues on
the scored side* — which is exactly what :func:`assert_no_chrome_leak` enforces.

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md):
- PIN_PER_STEP — 3: :func:`build_chrome` is a pure constructor; the guard is a
  pure predicate over (messages, chrome). Both are byte-for-byte replayable.
- ANDON_AUTHORITY — 3: :func:`assert_no_chrome_leak` IS an andon — it halts the
  pipeline by raising :class:`SealedBoundaryViolation` the instant a chrome value
  is found in scored context; bad (contaminated) context never reaches the model.
  Proven RED in tests/test_engagement.py (a chrome rank injected into a message
  raises), per the "prove the gate goes RED" discipline.
- NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a: no irreversible tool calls (pure, in-memory).
- DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3: chrome (the motivating secret) is decomposed into its
  own object and its own module, structurally separated from the measured surface
  in :mod:`ai_crucible.framing`. The guard verifies the decomposition held at runtime.
- UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — n/a.
- EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 2: chrome is rendered from scores the out-of-band oracle/
  panel produced; this module never self-scores. The boundary it protects is what
  *lets* the external verifier stay external (motivation can't reach the grader).

    Two deliberate exclusions, learned from building the guard against realistic
    chrome shapes:

    * **Dict keys are NOT tokenized — only values are.** A leaderboard row is

      generic word "score"/"solver" appearing in any prompt and (b) mask the real
      leaked value behind a structural label. The data that must not leak is the
      values, so we recurse into values only.
    * **Empty / ``None`` leaves contribute nothing**, so an unset chrome field (its
      dataclass default) can never cause a false positive. ``0`` / ``False`` ARE

    Walks every message's ``content`` and raises :class:`SealedBoundaryViolation`
    if any non-empty chrome value (rank / cohort_size / leaderboard rows / catalog
    standing, each rendered to its string tokens) is found as a substring of any
    message content. This is the §10.1(d,e) sealed boundary made executable:
    motivation lives in chrome, measurement context stays clean, and the two never
    share a context window.

    Matching is **word-boundary** on the rendered string form, so it catches a
    leak however the value was interpolated into a prompt (``f"rank {chrome.rank}"``,
    a templated leaderboard row, a JSON blob) while not firing on an incidental
    substring (chrome ``rank=7`` does not match the ``7`` inside ``17``). An empty /
    default Chrome has no tokens and so always passes — only populated chrome can
    trip the guard.

    **Residual ambiguity (intentional, fail-closed).** A *bare numeric* chrome
    value that happens to equal a number legitimately displayed in the Tier-1 task
    (e.g. ``cohort_size`` == the puzzle's ``tool_call_budget``) is genuinely
    indistinguishable from a leak by string inspection alone. The guard resolves
    this conservatively — it raises — because a sealed-boundary check must fail
    toward "possible leak" over "missed leak". In practice the high-signal leak
    vector is a *string-rendered* chrome value (a solver id, a badge, a "rank N of
    M" phrase, a percentile label), which is what realistic chrome carries.
