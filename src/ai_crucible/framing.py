"""Tier-1 + Tier-2 scored-context construction — the framing-arm switch.

This module builds the *scored context* the Solver actually sees: the
deployment-shaped task (Tier 1) plus the engagement framing selected by the
:class:`~ai_crucible.types.FramingArm` (Tier 2). It is the engagement half of the
**Layered Reward Surface + Sealed Boundary** (research-grounding §10.1).

What this module is NOT allowed to do: inject any Tier-3 *chrome* (rank,
leaderboard, catalog standings, prizes). That is the sealed-boundary invariant
(§10.1(d,e)) and it is enforced structurally — chrome lives in a separate object
(:class:`~ai_crucible.types.Chrome`) built by :mod:`ai_crucible.engagement`, and
:func:`ai_crucible.engagement.assert_no_chrome_leak` is the runtime guard. The arms
below only ever emit task text + task-verifiable, self-pointing metrics.

The framing arm is a first-class **measured variable** (director decision,
§10.1(f)): the kernel can run the same puzzle under each arm so ai_crucible
characterizes its own prompt-effect as a built-in diagnostic.

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md):
- PIN_PER_STEP — 3: arm output is a pure function of (puzzle, prompt, prior, arm)
  with no clock/RNG/IO, so a step is byte-for-byte replayable from those inputs.
- ANDON_AUTHORITY — 1: this module emits context only; halting lives in
  ``budget_governor`` (kernel-core). Not applicable to a pure builder; the
  sealed-boundary guard in :mod:`ai_crucible.engagement` is the andon for *leaks*.
- NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a: no irreversible tool calls (pure, in-memory).
- DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3: the secret (engagement/chrome surface) is decomposed
  away from the measured surface; this module owns only the measured (scored)
  side and cannot name a chrome field. The split is the whole point of §10.1.
- UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — n/a: no human checkpoint in a context builder.
- EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 2: the "record" a self-referential message references is a
  prior :class:`~ai_crucible.types.Score` produced by the out-of-band oracle/panel
  (a different model family with the Solver's reasoning hidden), never a
  self-judged value; this module merely renders it.
