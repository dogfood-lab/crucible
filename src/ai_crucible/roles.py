"""Concrete roles (``roles`` module, research-grounding §10.3).

The five model-agnostic role slots — :class:`Designer`, :class:`Solver`,
:class:`Critic`, :class:`Judge`, :class:`CohortSolver` — each implement the
:class:`ai_crucible.types.Role` protocol (``name`` + ``async def act``).

Two invariants are structural here, not aspirational:

1. **Single model-I/O choke point (§10.2).** Every role is constructed with an
   injected ``generate: Callable[[AttemptState], Awaitable[str]]`` and routes
   *all* model calls through it. Roles never import or call a model client
   directly, so every model call is observable at one point and testable with a
   fake ``generate``.

2. **Sealed Tier-3 boundary (§10.1(d,e), §10.3).** No role reads
   ``state.chrome``. Rank / leaderboard / standings are human-facing UI only and
   must never enter a context window the model solves in. To make accidental
   reads impossible (not merely discouraged), each ``act`` runs under a tiny
   guard that raises if ``state.chrome`` is touched during the role's turn.

Only :class:`Solver` is wired to sandbox tools and a
:class:`ai_crucible.budget.BudgetGovernor` (the tool boundary, §10.3). The
:class:`Critic` is interface-complete but **default-off** — the kernel decides
whether to invoke it per puzzle (§10.3); its value is narrow and it can regress
a strong Solver via conformity, so it is reserved, not wired on.
