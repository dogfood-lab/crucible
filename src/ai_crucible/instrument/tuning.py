"""Stage 2 — the 7-step tuning protocol (research-grounding §9.4).

Tuning a measurement instrument without compromising its measurements has a
specific answer: **multi-stage separation between hypothesis-locking, tuning, and
release**, with the validation set touched exactly once per bundle hash. This
module implements the load-bearing, fully-real parts of the §9.4 7-step protocol
and provides clearly-marked documented stubs for the parts whose full
implementation is out of Phase-1 scope.

The seven steps and their status here:

1. **Split inventory 60/20/10/10** — :func:`split_inventory`. REAL. Per
   **Dwork, Feldman, Hardt, Pitassi, Reingold & Roth 2015** ("The Reusable
   Holdout," *Science* 349(6248):636-638, arXiv:1506.02629): reusing a single
   holdout adaptively decays validity; the multi-split structure bounds this.
   Each split manifest is content-hashed (a maintainer publishes a Datasheet per
   split — Gebru et al. 2018, arXiv:1803.09010).
2. **Sobol screen** — :func:`sobol_screen`. REAL, wraps
   ``scipy.stats.sobol_indices`` (**Saltelli et al. 2010**, *Comput. Phys.
   Commun.* 181(2):259-270). Total-effect index T_i identifies load-bearing vs
   noise parameters; freeze T_i≈0.
3. **BO-search top-T_i weights** — :func:`bo_search`. DOCUMENTED STUB. The
   protocol (**Snoek, Larochelle & Adams 2012**, NeurIPS 2012) is specified;
   the full GP loop is out of Phase-1 scope and raises ``NotImplementedError``
   with the exact contract a future implementation must satisfy.
4. **Paraphrase-ablate judge prompts** — :func:`paraphrase_ablate`. DOCUMENTED
   STUB (**JudgeSense**, Bellibatlu et al. 2026, arXiv:2604.23478). The decision
   rule (drop findings whose sign flips under paraphrase) is documented; the
   paraphrase-generation + re-scoring loop is out of Phase-1 scope.
5. **Validate the locked bundle ONCE on `validation`** — enforced by
   :class:`ThresholdoutBudget` semantics + the split structure; you cannot
   iterate on validation.
6. **Seal `private_test`** — :func:`split_inventory` produces it; it is never
   queried by the tuning loop.
7. **Publish** the bundle + ``TUNING.md`` provenance + Sobol report + BO trace +
   per-split Datasheet — :func:`split_inventory` and :func:`sobol_screen` return
   exactly the provenance fields ``TUNING.md`` records.

:class:`ThresholdoutBudget` (step 3) tracks the dev-set query budget so adaptive
reuse stays bounded (**Dwork 2015**).

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md):
- PIN_PER_STEP — 3: :func:`split_inventory` takes a deterministic ``seed_note``
  and a *given order* of ids (it does NOT call ``random``/the clock), so a split
  is byte-for-byte reproducible and its manifest hash is the pin. :func:`sobol_screen`
  takes an explicit ``seed`` so the Saltelli sample is reproducible.
- ANDON_AUTHORITY — 2: :class:`ThresholdoutBudget.query` raises a structured
  ``TuningBudgetError`` when the dev-query budget is exhausted — the protocol
  halts rather than silently over-querying the holdout (the §9.4 step-3 defect).
  :func:`split_inventory` raises on a duplicate/empty id set.
- NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a: pure computation, no irreversible tool call. (Sealing
  ``private_test`` is enforced by *not* querying it, not by an undoable action.)
- DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3: the split structure (which changes per inventory) is
  separated from the budget tracker (which changes per query) and from the
  sensitivity screen (which changes per parameter set); the sealed
  ``private_test`` is decomposed away from every queryable split by construction.
- UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — 2: the Thresholdout budget *is* the gate — it caps
  how much the human can adaptively interrogate the dev split before the result
  is no longer trustworthy, and it reports remaining budget contrastively.
- EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 2: split manifest hashes let an external auditor confirm
  the splits were disjoint and unchanged without re-running anything; the Sobol
  report tells the auditor which weights were even tunable. The stubs explicitly
  refuse to fake a result (NotImplementedError, not a plausible number).
