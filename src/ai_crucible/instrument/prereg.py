"""Stage 1 — Pre-registration scaffolding (research-grounding §9.3).

AI Crucible is a measurement instrument, and the literature on keeping a tuned
instrument trustworthy is unambiguous: **lock the methodology and the scoring
formula before the production run** (Gelman & Loken 2014 "Garden of Forking
Paths"; Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn 2011 "False-Positive Psychology" —
undisclosed flexibility inflates the false-positive rate from a nominal 5% to
~60%). This module produces the two artifacts §9.3 mandates *before* Phase 4
runs a single puzzle:

1. :func:`aspredicted_template` — the 9-question AsPredicted short form
   (https://aspredicted.org; Chambers & Tzavella 2022, *Nature Human Behaviour*
   6:29-42, doi:10.1038/s41562-021-01193-7). 30 minutes to fill, yields a
   timestamped citable URL.
2. :func:`reforms_checklist` — the REFORMS items skeleton (Kapoor et al. 2024,
   *Science Advances* 10(18):eadk3452; arXiv:2308.07832), the 19-author
   ML-science reporting consensus, published alongside results.
3. :func:`render_preregistration` — renders filled answers to a Markdown
   document suitable for committing to ``ai_crucible-results`` and pasting into the
   AsPredicted form.

These are **scaffolding** (§9.9): they don't run a puzzle, they make Phase 4
audit-ready by construction. The locked content is fixed by §9.3 and not a
free-for-all: the **rubric, axes, model list, K seeds, primary statistical test
(McNemar's exact), and the multiple-comparison correction (BH-FDR)** are the
load-bearing locks. The template pre-fills ai_crucible's defaults for exactly those
so the act of pre-registration cannot silently drift from the locked design.

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md):
- PIN_PER_STEP — 3: every function is a pure function of its arguments with no
  clock/RNG/IO; the same ``answers`` dict renders the same Markdown byte-for-byte,
  so a pre-registration artifact is replayable from its inputs.
- ANDON_AUTHORITY — 2: :func:`render_preregistration` *raises* (structured
  ``PreregError``) on a missing required answer rather than emitting a
  silently-incomplete pre-registration — a defect halts here instead of
  propagating a half-locked methodology downstream into the production run.
- NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a: no irreversible tool calls (pure, in-memory string
  building). The downstream irreversible act (filing the AsPredicted URL) is a
  human step outside this module.
- DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3: the pre-registration surface (what is locked, the
  question text) changes together and lives here; it shares no state with the
  tuning or scoring surfaces. The *answers* (which change per study) are passed
  in, separate from the *form* (which is stable).
- UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — 3: pre-registration *is* the uncertainty gate — it
  forces the human to commit the methodology before seeing data, the §9.3
  defense against the garden of forking paths. The template frames each lock
  contrastively (default value + the §-citation that justifies it).
- EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 2: the artifacts this module emits are precisely what an
  *external* assessor checks (§9.6, §9.8 checklist items 1-2); the module's job
  is to make that external verification mechanical. It does not verify its own
  output beyond required-field presence.
