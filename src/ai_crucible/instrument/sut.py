"""Stage 4 — the System-Under-Test record, ``SUT.yaml`` (research-grounding §9.6).

Per **MLCommons MLPerf Inference Rules** (the strictest reproducibility regime in
industrial ML eval): every release ships a SUT description pinning the *exact*
system measured. The load-bearing discipline is **exact version strings, not
family aliases** — ``claude-opus-4-7-20260415``, never ``claude-opus``. A family
alias silently re-points as the provider updates the model, and per
arXiv:2510.25506 + arXiv:2512.00651 silent model-version drift causes >40% of
"functional" eval artifacts to fail within months. The SUT is **frozen from
submission through publication**.

:class:`SUT` holds the five §9.6-mandated fields; :func:`render_sut_yaml` emits a
deterministic ``SUT.yaml`` whose fields round-trip exactly (the value an auditor
reads back is the value that was recorded). YAML is rendered by hand — stable key
order, quoted scalars — so the output is byte-deterministic and the module needs
no YAML dependency (mirroring the canonical-JSON discipline in the ``attestation``
and ``rubric_bundle`` modules). :func:`parse_sut_yaml` reads it back so the
round-trip is testable and an auditor's tooling has a reference parser.

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md):
- PIN_PER_STEP — 3: the SUT.yaml *is* the per-run pin (model snapshot + harness
  commit + container digest + system-prompt hash). :func:`render_sut_yaml` is a
  pure function of the :class:`SUT`, so identical SUTs render identical bytes.
- ANDON_AUTHORITY — 2: :func:`render_sut_yaml` raises a structured ``SUTError``
  on a field that looks like a family alias rather than an exact version (e.g. a
  ``model_id`` with no version/snapshot component) — catching the single most
  common §9.6 reproducibility defect at render time rather than letting a
  non-reproducible SUT ship.
- NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a: pure string rendering, no irreversible tool call.
  (Freezing/publishing the SUT is a Phase-10 release step with its own
  compensators.)
- DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3: the SUT surface (exact versions, frozen per release)
  is its own module, separate from the rubric bundle (tuned) and the splits
  (per-inventory) — three things that change on three different cadences.
- UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — 1: the alias-shaped-id check nudges the human to
  supply an exact version, but the deeper "is this really the snapshot you ran?"
  question is a human responsibility this module can only prompt, not verify.
- EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 3: SUT.yaml is consumed by an *external* assessor to
  reproduce the run; :func:`parse_sut_yaml` is a reference reader so their tooling
  and ai_crucible's agree byte-for-byte on what was pinned.
