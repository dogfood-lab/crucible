"""Stage 4 — Inspect-AI-compatible task definition (research-grounding §9.6).

§9.6 calls building Inspect-compatible task definitions **"the highest-leverage
move for credibility"** — UK AISI's Inspect AI (github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/
inspect_ai) is the de-facto frontier eval framework, adopted by Anthropic,
DeepMind, and others, so peer auditors *already have the tooling* to run a
ai_crucible task. This module maps a ai_crucible puzzle (:class:`~ai_crucible.types.
PuzzleMeta` + the Solver-facing prompt) onto the Inspect ``Task`` shape.

The mapping uses the installed ``inspect_ai`` package's real types where natural:
the per-puzzle item becomes an Inspect :class:`inspect_ai.dataset.Sample`
(``input`` = the prompt, ``id`` = the puzzle id, ``metadata`` = the capability
aspect / class / tier / budgets), and the result is returned as a plain dict
(``model_dump`` of the Sample plus a scorer *reference* and the budget limits).
A dict — rather than a constructed :class:`inspect_ai.Task` object — is the right
return type here because:

1. A real ``Task`` needs a bound ``solver`` and ``scorer`` callable; in ai_crucible
   those are the kernel's Solver role and the sealed out-of-band oracle (§10.4),
   which are NOT this module's to instantiate (exclusive ownership) and must NOT
   be importable from the Solver side anyway (the oracle is sealed).
2. The §9.6 deliverable is the *task definition format* — the
   serialisable, auditable description — which is exactly a dict. An auditor
   materialises it into a live ``Task`` on their side with their own model + the
   published scorer.

The crucial sealed-oracle invariant (§10.4, §1 SWE-bench hidden-oracle pattern)
is honored here: the returned task definition carries a scorer **reference**
(a name/uri), never the oracle assertions themselves. The Solver sees ``input``;
it never sees ``target`` (left empty) or the grading logic.

:func:`two_repo_layout` documents the §9.6 ``ai_crucible-harness`` + ``ai_crucible-
results`` split (the SEPARATE-REPOS concern) as data, without creating any repo.

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md):
- PIN_PER_STEP — 3: :func:`to_inspect_task` is a pure function of
  ``(puzzle_meta, prompt)``; the same inputs serialise to the same dict, and the
  dict pins the budgets + scorer ref + puzzle id so a run is replayable.
- ANDON_AUTHORITY — 2: raises a structured ``InspectTaskError`` on an empty
  prompt or a puzzle meta that cannot supply a scorer reference — a malformed
  task definition halts here rather than producing an unscoreable Inspect task.
- NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a: pure in-memory construction, no irreversible action.
- DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3: the *public* task surface (prompt, id, budgets,
  scorer reference) is built here; the *secret* (oracle assertions) is decomposed
  entirely away onto the grading side and only referenced by name — the module
  structurally cannot leak it because it never holds it.
- UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — n/a: no human checkpoint in a format builder.
- EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 3: the whole point — the task definition is the artifact an
  *external* auditor loads into their own Inspect install with a *different*
  model to reproduce ai_crucible's numbers without trusting ai_crucible's harness.
