"""Stage 2 — the content-hashed rubric bundle (research-grounding §9.1, §9.4).

The §9.1 animating principle: *a tuned ai_crucible reports the protocol, not the
weights — and the release is not "v1.0 weights" but ``v1.0/rubric.bundle.sha256``
plus the documented protocol that produced it.* This module is the compiler for
that artifact.

Grounding:
- **Hong et al. 2026 — "RULERS: Locked Rubrics and Evidence-Anchored Scoring"**
  (arXiv:2601.08654). The rubric is compiled to a content-hashed bundle; the
  leaderboard records ``(model_id, score, bundle_hash)``. A new bundle hash is a
  new instrument — "no silent retconning" (§9.1).
- **Cawley & Talbot 2010 — "On Over-fitting in Model Selection and Subsequent
  Selection Bias"** (JMLR 11:2079-2107). Tuning that is not pinned to a hash is
  selection bias laundered as a single number.

A :class:`RubricBundle` holds the four tunable surfaces — penalty/component
``weights``, gate ``thresholds``, ``judge_prompts``, and a human-readable
``version`` string. :func:`compile_bundle` canonicalises it to RFC-8785-style
JSON and returns ``(sha256_hex, canonical_bytes)``; the hash is the anchor every
downstream attestation (in-toto predicate, RFC 3161 timestamp, Rekor inclusion
proof) binds to (§9.5). :func:`bump_on_change` enforces the §9.1 invariant: the
version changes iff the content hash changes, so two byte-identical bundles can
never carry two different versions and a changed bundle can never silently keep
the old version.

NOTE on the version field and the hash: the ``version`` string is deliberately
**excluded from the hashed material**. The hash is a fingerprint of the *scoring
content* (weights/thresholds/judge_prompts) — what actually changes a model's
score — not of the label we give it. This is what lets :func:`bump_on_change`
ask the well-posed question "did the scoring content change?" and answer it from
the hash alone. (If the version were hashed, every rename would look like a new
instrument and the invariant would be circular.)

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md):
- PIN_PER_STEP — 3: :func:`compile_bundle` is the embodiment of this standard —
  it turns a bundle into a byte-exact, hash-addressable artifact so a tuning run
  is replayable from ``bundle_hash`` alone. Pure function, no clock/RNG/IO.
- ANDON_AUTHORITY — 2: a defect (e.g. a bundle whose content cannot be
  canonicalised) raises a structured ``RubricBundleError`` at compile time rather
  than emitting an unhashable / non-reproducible artifact downstream.
- NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a: pure in-memory compilation, no irreversible tool
  call. (The irreversible act — publishing a bundle hash to the leaderboard /
  Rekor — lives in the attestation module and Phase-10 release, with their own
  compensators.)
- DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3: the four tunable surfaces are grouped into one
  hashable object that changes together; the *version label* (which changes on a
  different cadence — human decision) is held as a separate, un-hashed field.
- UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — 2: :func:`bump_on_change` is the gate that forces a
  human-visible version increment exactly when (and only when) the scoring
  content changed; it frames the decision contrastively (returns old vs new
  version with the hash as evidence).
- EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 3: the content hash is verifiable by *any* third party with
  the canonical bytes and a SHA-256 implementation — the verification needs no
  trust in ai_crucible and no access to ai_crucible's reasoning. This is the §9.6
  independent-verification primitive in its smallest form.
