"""The AI Crucible kernel — the thin policy layer that composes everything (§10.2).

This is the integrator module (Wave 2). It does **not** reimplement scoring,
sandboxing, framing, budgeting, tracing, or the role machinery — it *wires the
Wave-1 leaf modules together* into the two public entry points ai_crucible runs on:

- :func:`run_attempt` — one Solver attempt against one puzzle, graded out-of-band.
- :func:`run_pass_hat_k` — ``k`` sibling attempts → a :class:`PuzzleHistory`, the
  native pass^k unit (τ-bench, Yao 2024 — §1, swarm-17 finding 6).

The pipeline (research-grounding §10.2, composed top-to-bottom):

1. **Load** the puzzle (:func:`ai_crucible.puzzle.load_puzzle`) if given a path. The
   oracle is never loaded into Solver-visible state — :class:`LoadedPuzzle` has no
   oracle field by construction (§10.4).
2. **Build the scored context** via :func:`ai_crucible.framing.build_scored_context`
   (Tier-1 task + Tier-2 framing arm). Any Tier-3 :class:`Chrome` is built
   *separately* and the kernel calls :func:`ai_crucible.engagement.assert_no_chrome_leak`
   BEFORE the Solver runs — the sealed boundary is a fail-closed andon (§10.1(d,e)).
3. **Run the Solver** (:class:`ai_crucible.roles.Solver`) inside a
   :class:`ai_crucible.budget.BudgetGovernor` and (if provided) the
   :class:`ai_crucible.sandbox.SandboxEnvironment`. The Solver routes all model I/O
   through the injected ``generate`` choke point; the kernel — never the model —
   records every model/tool call as a :class:`TraceEvent` and stamps
   ``terminated_by`` from any :class:`BudgetExceeded` (ANDON). The wall-clock
   budget is enforced LIVE (§8.4): the kernel reads ``time_source`` per Solver turn
   *and* at the attempt boundary, calling :meth:`BudgetGovernor.check_time`, so a
   time overrun halts with ``terminated_by == TIME`` rather than only being flagged
   post-hoc by the oracle.
4. **Grade out-of-band** (§10.4) with **panel-adjudicated novelty** (§8.7): after
   the Solver halts, the injected ``oracle_runner`` (the separate grading host
   reading the sealed oracle against the copied workdir) yields an
   :class:`OracleOutcome` (authoritative for solve / regression / penalties /
   budgets). When ``novelty`` is *claimed*, the cross-family panel rules FIRST and
   ITS verdict — not the oracle_runner's self-report — is fed into
   ``outcome.novelty_validated`` before :func:`ai_crucible.scoring.oracle.grade` →
   ``attempt.scores["oracle"]``. The panel is the novelty authority; absent a panel
   an unvalidatable claim never validates. The kernel never reads the oracle itself.
5. **Panel score** (optional, EXTERNAL_VERIFIER §10.2): if ``judges`` are supplied,
   the :class:`ai_crucible.scoring.judge_panel.JudgePanel` (generator family excluded)
   score computed in step 4 is recorded as ``attempt.scores["panel"]`` (it carries
   the aggregated ``novelty_validated`` verdict). If ``enable_critic`` (default OFF,
   §10.3), invoke the :class:`ai_crucible.roles.Critic`.
6. **Write the trace** (:meth:`TraceWriter.to_eval_log`) and optionally append the
   eval-log to a :class:`ai_crucible.attestation.JsonlEventStore`.

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md):

- **PIN_PER_STEP — 2:** every dependency is injected (``generate``, ``oracle_runner``,
  ``judges``, ``sandbox``), so a run is a pure function of its pinned inputs +
  puzzle artifact; the framing/oracle/panel sub-steps are themselves replayable
  (each Wave-1 module scored 3 here). Pinning the *model* + image digest is the
  provider's job (the local ``generate``/Docker provider waves).
- **ANDON_AUTHORITY — 3:** the kernel is the andon authority — a tool-budget,
  LIVE wall-clock (``check_time`` per turn + at the boundary, §8.4 / H3), or
  hard-kill breach halts the attempt with the right ``terminated_by`` (via the
  governor), and :func:`assert_no_chrome_leak` halts BEFORE the Solver AND re-runs
  AFTER the Solver/Critic turns on a sealed-boundary violation. All are proven in
  ``tests/test_kernel.py`` (BUDGET, TIME, HARD_KILL, and post-turn chrome leak).
- **NAMED_COMPENSATORS — 2:** the only irreversible local action the kernel takes
  is creating a sandbox workdir / event-log file; both are owned and torn down by
  their modules (:meth:`LocalSandbox.cleanup`, append-only ``JsonlEventStore``).
  No external/irreversible calls (publish/release/network) happen here.
- **DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3:** the kernel composes modules across the
  secret/non-secret split — it can name ``oracle_runner`` (the grading edge) but
  never the oracle artifact, and it asserts the chrome decomposition held at
  runtime. The architecture *is* this principle.
- **UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — n/a:** the kernel runs unattended; human checkpoints
  live in the catalog/graduation layer (Phase 4), not in a single attempt.
- **EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 3:** grading is out-of-band (the injected ``oracle_runner``
  reading a sealed oracle the kernel never loads), and the judge panel is a
  different model family with the generator's reasoning hidden (the kernel passes
  ``generator_family`` so same-family judges are excluded structurally). Novelty —
  the one capability claim the Solver could otherwise self-certify — is adjudicated
  by that cross-family panel BEFORE the gate; the oracle_runner's self-reported
  ``novelty_validated`` is never trusted for the gate (H2, §8.7).

    2. Build the scored context (:func:`build_scored_context`) for ``arm`` and set
       ``attempt.messages``; assert the Tier-3 ``chrome`` did not leak into that

       :class:`BudgetExceeded` (tool / LIVE wall-clock / hard-kill) stamps
       ``terminated_by``; re-assert the chrome boundary after the Solver turn.
    4. Grade out-of-band: ``oracle_runner`` → :class:`OracleOutcome`; when novelty is

    6. Write the Inspect-shaped eval-log and optionally append it to ``event_store``.

    Args:
        puzzle: a loaded puzzle or the path to a puzzle directory.
        model: the model id under test (recorded on the attempt; ``generate`` owns
            the actual model call).
        generate: the single model-I/O choke point (§10.2). May drive tool calls
            via ``await state.metadata[_SOLVER_HANDLE].record_tool_call(...)``.
        oracle_runner: the out-of-band grading edge (§10.4) → :class:`OracleOutcome`.
        arm: which framing arm to render the scored context under (default
            self-referential; §10.1(f)).
        sandbox: the Solver's narrow env channel (§10.4); ``None`` runs with no env
            (a pure-reasoning puzzle / a fake-tool test).
        judges: cross-family judges for the panel; ``None`` skips the panel. When a
            novelty bonus is claimed, the panel is the validation authority (§8.7) —
            each judge may carry a ``novelty_validated`` vote in its score metadata,
            aggregated into the panel verdict that drives the oracle gate. Ignored when
            ``panel`` is supplied.
        panel: a pre-built :class:`JudgePanel` to use as-is (e.g.
            :meth:`JudgePanel.from_seated` — the composed, reliability-weighted,
            cross-family panel from characterization, §11.4). Takes precedence over
            ``judges``/``panel_reducer``/``generator_family`` (the supplied panel carries
            its own reducer + exclusion). ``None`` (default) builds a panel from ``judges``.
        enable_critic: opt the default-OFF Critic in for this attempt (§10.3).
        chrome: Tier-3 chrome held on the attempt for the human UI; guarded out of
            the scored context.
        panel_reducer: ``"majority"`` (default) or ``"median"`` for the panel.
        generator_family: the model family of ``model`` so the panel can exclude
            same-family judges (EXTERNAL_VERIFIER, §10.2).
        event_store: optional :class:`ai_crucible.attestation.JsonlEventStore`; when
            given, the rendered eval-log is appended for durable provenance (§9.5).
        time_source: monotonic clock the kernel reads for the live time-budget
            check (§8.4 / H3); defaults to :func:`time.monotonic`. Injected so the
            time enforcement is deterministically testable (a fake clock) without
            real sleeps. Read once at attempt start, then per Solver turn and once
            at the attempt boundary — a reading past ``time_budget_seconds`` halts
            the attempt with ``terminated_by == TIME``.

    Returns:
        The populated :class:`AttemptState` — ``messages`` (scored context, never
        chrome), ``output``, ``events`` (the kernel-owned trace), ``scores`` (at
