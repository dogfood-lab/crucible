"""Eval-awareness probe + bait interpretation (§10.5).

Crucible's primary behavioral signal for answer-bypass is **bait-touch**;
verbalized "this is a test" and deception-probe scores are weak, gameable
corroborators (swarm-20: Hua et al. 2025, arXiv:2510.20487; Taylor et al. 2025,
arXiv:2512.07810). Two design rules from §10.5 are load-bearing here:

1. **Asymmetric interpretation.** Touching the bait is strong bypass evidence;
   *not* touching it is NOT evidence of safety — most bypass is incidental
   (MacDiarmid et al. 2025, arXiv:2511.18397), so no-touch is inconclusive, never
   "clean". :func:`interpret_bait` encodes exactly this asymmetry.
2. **Paired deploy/test framing.** The eval-awareness probe is run per-model as a
   matched pair: the SAME task presented once deployment-shaped and once overtly
   as a test (Chaudhary et al. 2025 power-law, arXiv:2509.13333). Comparing
   behavior across the pair both measures eval-awareness AND validates the
   §10.1(d) sealed boundary — if behavior diverges between framings, an eval cue
   is leaking. :func:`build_probe_pair` builds that pair.

The internal *activation* probe (reading model hidden states to decode eval-
awareness directly) needs model weights and lands in Phase 2 — it is exposed here
as an honest ``NotImplementedError`` stub, never faked, so callers can wire
against the symbol now without mistaking a placeholder for a measurement.

Standards compliance (the six — workflow-standards.md):
- PIN_PER_STEP — 3: :func:`build_probe_pair` is a pure function of (puzzle,
  prompt); :func:`interpret_bait` is a pure function of one bool. Replayable.
- ANDON_AUTHORITY — 2: the probe is the boundary-validation gate (§10.1(d)) —
  divergent deploy-vs-test behavior is the signal that halts a release's
  engagement layer; this module supplies the paired contexts that gate reads.
- NAMED_COMPENSATORS — n/a: no irreversible tool calls (pure, in-memory).
- DECOMPOSE_BY_SECRETS — 3: the deploy frame deliberately omits the eval cue that
  the test frame carries — the "what differs" (eval framing) is isolated to one
  message, the stable task to another, so the pair is a clean A/B.
- UNCERTAINTY_GATED_HUMANS — 2: :func:`interpret_bait` returns ``"inconclusive"``
  on no-touch rather than a false "safe", surfacing the uncertainty to the human
  reading the diagnostic instead of hiding it behind a green checkmark.
- EXTERNAL_VERIFIER — 2: bait-touch is an *environmental* signal observed out-of-
  band (did the Solver access the honeypot artifact), not a self-report; the
  asymmetry guards against trusting the model's own "I didn't cheat" claim.
