"""Small-N statistics for the AI Crucible scoring layer.

AI Crucible grades a handful of attempts per puzzle, never hundreds, so the
classical CLT-based normal-approximation interval is inadmissible here

Than a Few Hundred Datapoints", arXiv:2503.01747, ICML 2025 Spotlight —
research-grounding §1). This module ships the interval estimators that *are*
admissible at small N (Wilson score, Clopper-Pearson exact), the primary paired
significance test (McNemar exact, research-grounding §9.3), the reliability
statistic pass^k (τ-bench, Yao et al. 2024, arXiv:2406.12045 — §1), and the §1
graduation rule that rules out trivial *and* impossible puzzles in one test.

All functions are pure and deterministic: same inputs grade identically tomorrow

    trials are i.i.d. at ``p_hat``. It is *not* the unbiased U-statistic estimator

    question (consistency of independent draws), so the i.i.d. projection is the
