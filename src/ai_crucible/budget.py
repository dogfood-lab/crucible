"""Kernel-side budget governor (``budget_governor`` module, §8.4 + §10.2).

The governor wraps a :class:`ai_crucible.types.Budget` and is used as a context
manager around the **Solver block only** (§10.2). It is the single authority on
tool-call accounting, wall-clock budget, and pathological-loop detection — it
**never trusts the model to self-report** its usage (§10.2, Vivaria pattern).
When a limit is breached it raises :class:`BudgetExceeded`, carrying the
:class:`ai_crucible.types.TerminatedBy` reason so the kernel can stamp
``AttemptState.terminated_by`` at the attempt boundary.

Three independent signals (§8.4):

- **Tool-call budget** — ``record_tool_call`` increments ``tool_calls_used`` and
  raises ``BudgetExceeded(BUDGET)`` the moment usage would exceed
  ``tool_call_budget`` (an ANDON halt: bad/over-budget output never propagates).
- **Hard kill** — N *consecutive* identical ``(tool, args)`` calls is a
  pathological loop (WebArena pattern, arXiv:2307.13854). Raises
  ``BudgetExceeded(HARD_KILL)``. N defaults to 3, overridable per puzzle via
  ``PuzzleMeta.hard_kill_consecutive_identical``.
- **Time budget** — ``check_time`` raises ``BudgetExceeded(TIME)`` once elapsed
  wall-clock exceeds ``time_budget_seconds``.

This module is the *enforcement floor*; the displayed budget that the Solver
self-rations against (BATS, arXiv:2511.17006) is a Tier-1 task-relevant signal
rendered separately from the live :class:`Budget` value object.
