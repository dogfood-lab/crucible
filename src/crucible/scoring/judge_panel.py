"""Cross-family judge panel — the EXTERNAL_VERIFIER mitigation (§10.2, §3).

The single strongest mitigation against same-model self-preference is a panel of
judges drawn from *disjoint model families* (Verga et al. 2024, "Replacing Judges
with Juries / PoLL", arXiv:2404.18796 — research-grounding §3): a 3-model
cross-family panel correlates with humans better than a single GPT-4 judge at 1/7
the cost. The bias being defended against is mechanistic — a model over-rates its
own low-perplexity text (Wataoka et al. 2024, arXiv:2410.21819 — §1) — so
"different prompt" is not enough; the judge must come from a different
*distribution*. Crucible enforces this **structurally**: any judge whose family
equals the generator's family is excluded from the panel before aggregation
(EXTERNAL_VERIFIER, workflow-standard 6 + research-grounding §10.2,§10.7).

In Phase 2 the judges are real cross-family local models (Qwen + Mistral +
Command-R, via ollama-intern + RTX 5090 — §8.6). Here, in Phase 1, judges are
**injected async callables** so the panel logic is unit-testable without a model
runtime. Each judge is a ``Callable[[AttemptState], Awaitable[Score]]``; its model
family is read from a ``family`` attribute on the callable (set by the kernel when
it wires a model into a judge), falling back to ``None`` (treated as "unknown
family", never excluded — an untagged judge is assumed external).

Aggregation is a reducer (PoLL pattern): ``"majority"`` vote for boolean/discrete
verdicts, ``"median"`` for numeric scores (median is the robust central estimate
that resists a single outlier judge — the reason a panel beats one judge).

**Novelty adjudication (§8.7).** The panel is *the authority* on whether a Solver's
claimed novel path is a legitimate alternative or a disguised bypass — novelty
validation needs distributional perspective from outside the Solver's family (PoLL
applied to a different question). A judge expresses its per-judge novelty verdict as
``novelty_validated: bool`` in its returned :class:`~crucible.types.Score.metadata`;
:func:`reduce_scores` aggregates those votes (majority of *cast* votes) into a panel
``novelty_validated`` verdict on the panel score. The kernel feeds THAT verdict into
the oracle gate — the oracle_runner's self-reported ``novelty_validated`` is never
trusted for the gate. Phase 1 uses *injected* judges (so the wiring is testable
without a model runtime); real cross-family panels (Qwen + Mistral + Command-R via
ollama-intern + RTX 5090) plug into the same shape at Phase 2 with no kernel change.
