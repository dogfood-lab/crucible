"""Crucible — a diagnostic adversarial game for frontier LLMs.

A policy-enforced kernel mediates a Designer -> Solver -> (Critic) -> Judge-panel
cycle, scores against a hidden oracle, and curates a Lab/Arena/Regression catalog.

The kernel is a thin policy layer on UK AISI's Inspect AI (research-grounding
docs/research-grounding.md, section 10.2). All cross-module contracts live in
:mod:`crucible.types`; module bodies implement against them.
