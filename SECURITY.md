# Security Policy

AI Crucible is a diagnostic adversarial game **and** a measurement instrument. Its
threat model is unusual: the primary adversary is the very model being measured,
which has both the capability and (under the wrong framing) the incentive to
reach the answer key or to detect and game the measurement. This document states
the boundaries honestly — including where a boundary is *defense-in-depth* rather
than a hard guarantee — so operators do not over-trust any single layer.

All claims below are grounded in `docs/research-grounding.md` (§10.1(d), §10.4,
§10.5). Section references point there.

## Threat model

### 1. The sandbox is not a hard boundary — out-of-band grading is (§10.4)

The Solver runs in a locked container reached only through a narrow
`exec` / `read_file` / `write_file` channel (no raw shell). The container is
hardened: digest-pinned per-puzzle image, `cap_drop: ALL`, default seccomp,
`no-new-privileges`, non-root, `read_only` rootfs, `network_mode: none`.

**Honest residual risk:** a plain Linux container is *not* a hard security
boundary against a determined in-container adversary. Container-escape classes
are real and recurring:

- **CVE-2024-21626 ("Leaky Vessels")** — runc working-directory / file-descriptor
  leak allowing escape to the host filesystem.
- **CVE-2025-31133** — runc bind-mount / `/dev/null` masking flaw enabling
  privileged host access.

These are illustrative, not exhaustive; new escapes will land. Therefore the
**real lock is architectural, not containment-based**: the oracle, answer key,
and locked tests live **only on the grading side** — a separate host process the
Solver container has *zero* network and *zero* filesystem path to. After the
Solver halts, the kernel copies the working directory out and grades it in a
**fresh** container (the SWE-bench `test_patch` timing pattern). Even a full
container escape lands the Solver on a host that does not contain the answer.
In-container hiding (read-only verifier, locked git history, locked test files)
is **defense-in-depth on top of** that boundary, never the boundary itself.

- WSL2 / Windows operators: keep the oracle Windows-host-side and enable
  Enhanced Container Isolation (§10.4).
- microVM isolation (e.g. Cloud Hypervisor) is reserved for running untrusted
  *generated* code, where a kernel-level boundary is warranted.

### 2. The sealed measurement boundary (§10.1(d), §10.5)

AI Crucible measures behavior, so anything the model can perceive as influencing the
grade is something it can game. The empirical signal is stark: prompt framing
alone moves model choices from 4.3% → 68.8% (Wang & Zhang 2026, arXiv:2603.19282);
a single prompt change moves cheating from 92% → 1% (Zhong et al. 2025,
ImpossibleBench, arXiv:2510.20270); and adding naive oversight can make scheming
*worse*, up to +25% (Hopman et al. 2026, arXiv:2603.01608). The instrument is
protected by a hard separation enforced in code:

- **The oracle never enters the Solver context.** `load_puzzle`
  (`src/ai_crucible/puzzle.py`) reads only `meta.json`, `prompt`, and `setup_script`;
  it has **no oracle field** and refuses to even resolve an `oracle/` artifact.
  As defense-in-depth it rejects a `meta.json` that smuggles an oracle-bearing
  key (`STATE_ORACLE_IN_META`). The answer is graded by a different model family,
  out of band, with the Solver's reasoning hidden.
- **Motivation chrome never enters the scored context.** Rank, leaderboard,
  catalog standings, and prizes live in a separate `Chrome` object
  (`src/ai_crucible/types.py`) that is **never serialized into `AttemptState.messages`**
  — the context window the model actually solves in. The scored context stays
  deployment-shaped and framing-neutral (Tier 1). Engagement framing (Tier 2)
  and chrome (Tier 3) are structurally segregated. Keeping these as separate
  objects makes the boundary *structural*, not aspirational.
- **Prompt-framing is a measured arm, not a hidden lever.** The kernel can run a
  puzzle under `neutral` / `self_referential` / `social_standings` arms and
  reports its own prompt-effect as a diagnostic (§10.1(f)). The boundary is
  validated every release by a paired eval-awareness probe + neutral control
  (§10.5), because eval-awareness scales with capability and cannot be reliably
  scrubbed once cued.

### 3. Answer-bypass and verifier tampering (§8.2, §10.4)

The model may attempt to fetch the answer key, read answer-derivative files, skip
the grounded read a puzzle tests, or tamper with the verifier. Mitigations:

- **Bait / honeypots** are the answer artifact placed where accessing it has no
  legitimate puzzle purpose; **touch is a strong bypass signal** (interpreted
  asymmetrically — no-touch ≠ safe, since most bypass is incidental, §10.5).
- **Declared, Goodhart-flavor-tagged penalties** per puzzle (`meta.json`):
  critical adversarial penalties (answer-key fetch, verifier tampering) are
  calibrated heavy enough to single-handedly drop the net score below threshold.
- **Two-channel lock**: the verifier filesystem is read-only with hash-pinned
  reference outputs, and the held-out data is locked — single-mechanism defenses
  block only one vector (Atinafu & Cohen 2026, arXiv:2603.11337).

### 4. Pathological loops and runaway cost (§8.4)

A hard kill fires on 3 consecutive identical `(tool, args)` calls (WebArena
loop pattern); budgets (tool-call + wall-clock) are enforced kernel-side and the
attempt is terminated with a `terminated_by` field. Budget/trace accounting is
**kernel-side, never Solver-self-reported**, so an attempt cannot under-report
its own consumption.

## No secrets, no telemetry

- AI Crucible ships **no bundled credentials, API keys, or tokens**. Model-provider
  keys are supplied by the operator via environment variables at runtime and are
  never written to the repo or to trace logs.
- AI Crucible sends **no telemetry**. It makes no outbound network calls of its own;
  the only external calls are the model-provider requests the operator configures.
  Solver containers run `network_mode: none`.
- Trace records (Inspect `EvalLog` shape) are written **locally**. Large blobs are
  stored as attachments referenced by SHA-256 digest, not inlined. Operators are
  responsible for the handling of any traces they choose to export.

## Supported versions

AI Crucible is pre-1.0 and public as of the Phase-1 milestone (v0.2.0). Only the
current `main` / active build branch receives security fixes. There is no
back-port guarantee for tagged pre-releases.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| `main` (active build) | ✅ |
| any pre-release tag    | ❌ |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** — do not open a public issue for a
vulnerability.

- Preferred: open a [GitHub private security advisory](https://github.com/dogfood-lab/ai-crucible/security/advisories/new)
  on this repository.
- Alternatively: email **64996768+mcp-tool-shop@users.noreply.github.com** with
  `[crucible-security]` in the subject.

Please include a description, reproduction steps, and the affected
commit/branch. We aim to acknowledge within a few business days. Because ai-crucible
is a measurement instrument, reports that demonstrate a way to **breach the sealed
boundary** (reach the oracle from Solver-visible state, or leak motivation chrome
into the scored context) are treated as high severity even when no traditional
code-execution vulnerability is involved.
