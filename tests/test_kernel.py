"""End-to-end tests for the AI Crucible kernel (ai_crucible.kernel).

The kernel is the Wave-2 integrator: it composes the Wave-1 leaf modules into
:func:`run_attempt` and :func:`run_pass_hat_k`. These tests drive the *real*
pipeline against the real sample puzzle fixture with injected fakes — a fake
``generate`` (canned model output) and a fake ``oracle_runner`` (canned
:class:`OracleOutcome`) — so the composition is exercised without a model runtime
or a grading host.

Async is driven with ``anyio.run`` (the repo convention; anyio ships with
inspect-ai, no pytest-asyncio).

Invariants proven (happy path + the RED paths the spec requires):
- A full :func:`run_attempt` on the sample fixture produces an AttemptState with
  ``scores["oracle"]``, a populated trace, and ``terminated_by == COMPLETED``.
- A looping fake ``generate`` (3 identical tool calls) trips the kernel-side
  hard-kill ANDON → ``terminated_by == HARD_KILL``.
- A fake ``generate`` exceeding the TOOL budget (distinct calls) → ``terminated_by
  == BUDGET`` (M3); a fake clock past the time budget → ``terminated_by == TIME``
  via the LIVE kernel-side ``check_time`` (H3 / M3).
- A chrome leak (a chrome value present in the scored context) raises
  :class:`SealedBoundaryViolation` BEFORE the Solver runs (RED, §10.1(e)); the
  kernel ALSO re-checks AFTER the Solver and Critic turns, catching an in-place
  message edit a per-turn role guard misses (H1, §10.1(e)).
- ``run_pass_hat_k(..., k=3)`` returns a :class:`PuzzleHistory` with 3 attempts.
- The oracle is NEVER present in ``attempt.messages`` (sealed boundary, §10.4).
