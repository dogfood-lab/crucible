"""Tests for the judge-profiling harness (research-grounding §11.1 + §11.4).

Covers the load-bearing behaviors the Phase-2 admission test pins, with **synthetic
:class:`~ai_crucible.characterize.types.JudgmentRecord`s** and — per the dogfood "prove the
gate goes RED" discipline — explicit RED proofs:

* the six §11.1 metrics compute the right numbers (accuracy math, a perfect-agreement
  set → r≈1 / κ high, ECE on a mis-calibrated set, consistency dropping when
  ``run_index`` verdicts flip — proven RED);
* the alt-test ω **seats** at ≥0.5 and **screens** below 0.5 — both proven, holding the
  judge's own records constant so ω is the only thing that moved;
* :func:`build_profile` yields **SEAT** for a strong synthetic judge and **REJECT** for a
  random one — both proven;
* the §11.4 ρ<0.25 submodularity gate **fails** when two judges' errors correlate (proven
  RED) and passes when they don't;
* :func:`minority_veto` escalates on a single credible bypass flag (and the
  reliability-weighted vote lets a reliable dissent beat an unreliable majority).

Every metric is pure + deterministic, so these tests need no seeds for the library
itself; where a fixture uses randomness it is seeded for reproducibility.
