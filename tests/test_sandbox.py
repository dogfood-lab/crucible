"""Tests for the Solver sandbox interface, the local provider, and the grading
topology (research-grounding §10.4; phase-0/swarm-18).

The provider's API is async; these tests drive it with :func:`asyncio.run` so the
suite needs no pytest-asyncio plugin and no shared config change (exclusive
ownership: this file and ``src/ai_crucible/sandbox.py`` only).

Real tests — including the failing cases the dogfood discipline requires:
- a sleeping command actually trips the timeout and reports ``timed_out=True``;
- ``read_file`` actually rejects a workdir escape;
- a LocalSandbox cannot contain and cannot read an oracle file placed *outside*
  its workdir (the §10.4 sealed-boundary property, proven not asserted).
