"""Tests for the concrete roles (ai_crucible.roles).

Async roles are driven with ``anyio.run`` (no pytest-asyncio dependency, and
``anyio`` ships with inspect-ai). The model-I/O choke point is exercised with a
fake ``generate`` (a canned async function), proving roles are testable without a
real model — which is the whole point of the §10.2 injected choke point.

Invariants proven (happy path + RED path where applicable):
- Single ``generate`` choke point: roles call only the injected fn (§10.2).
- Solver is the only role bound to sandbox tools + governor (§10.3).
- Budget enforcement flows through the governor and stamps ``terminated_by``.
- Sealed boundary: a role leaking Tier-3 chrome into ``messages`` goes RED
  (§10.1(e)); a well-behaved role does not.
- Critic is default-OFF and a no-op until explicitly enabled (§10.3).
